# IBC233
IBC233 introduces commercial and business information technology on the IBM iSeries server. Students will work in an object based architecture using Client Access and Websphere Development Studio Client for iSeries to create business applications. These applications will be developed using the built in DB2 relational database, OS/400 commands and Control Language programming, Query/400 data reporting, interactive screens, and webfacing. The Integrated File System, which provides Windows and UNIX file serving, along with desktop connectivity tools will be investigated to demonstrate the heterogeneous systems support available only on the iSeries platform.
